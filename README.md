I frequently need to be creative and quickly come up with solutions and tools for various situations. Although not all of these tools are equally useful, some of them have proven to be very effective.

In addition, I have a strong passion for debugging and automating tasks, which drives me to employ various scripting languages and debugging methodologies to streamline workflows and troubleshoot issues efficiently.
